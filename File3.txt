CPU fetches and executes each 
instruction of the program 
• Successively goes through 
fetch, execute and interrupt 
cycles 
It fetches internal instructions of the programs from the 
main memory to the processor instruction register, and 
based on this register contents, the control unit 
generates a control signal that supervises the execution 
of these instructions.
• A control unit works by receiving input information to 
which it converts into control signals, which are then 
sent to the central processor.
