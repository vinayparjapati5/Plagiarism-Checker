It is the responsibility of the Control Unit to tell the 
computer’s memory, arithmetic/logic unit and input and 
output devices how to respond to the instructions that 
have been sent to the processor. 
It fetches internal instructions of the programs from the 
main memory to the processor instruction register, and 
based on this register contents, the control unit 
generates a control signal that supervises the execution 
of these instructions.
A control unit works by receiving input information to 
which it converts into control signals, which are then 
sent to the central processor. 
The computer’s processor then tells the attached 
hardware what operations to perform.
